# Data-Visualization-of-Bird-Strikes-between-2000-2011
# Overview

This project utilizes Power BI to analyze and visualize bird strike data, aiming to improve aviation safety by identifying key patterns and trends. The dataset covers [specify the time range, e.g., 2000-2017] and includes 24,750 bird strike incidents, with information on weather conditions, geographical locations, flight phases, damage impact, and pilot warnings. Through comprehensive data analysis, this project seeks to provide actionable insights for mitigating the risks associated with bird strikes.
# Dataset Information
The dataset covers bird strike incidents from 2000-2011, with 24,750 records detailing the date, location, weather conditions, flight phase, altitude, aircraft and airline involved, damage incurred, cost implications, and pilot warnings.
# Key Findings

1.	Frequency Trends:

  	o	Bird strikes have shown an increasing trend over the analyzed years, indicating a growing concern for aviation safety.
2.	Weather Impact:

    o	The majority of bird strikes occur under clear weather conditions, suggesting higher bird activity and visibility during these times.
3.	Geographical Hotspots:

  	o	Certain states exhibit higher incidents of bird strikes, highlighting the need for targeted mitigation strategies in these areas.
4.	Flight Phases:

  	o	The approach and landing phases of flight see the highest number of bird strikes, emphasizing the importance of vigilance during these critical periods.
5.	Damage and Costs:

  	o	While most bird strikes do not result in damage, a significant number cause financial impact, underscoring the economic implications for airlines.
6.	Altitude and Warnings:

   	o	Most bird strikes occur at lower altitudes (below 1000 feet), with a considerable portion of incidents happening without prior warnings to pilots, highlighting the need for improved detection and warning systems.

# Conclusion 

The Bird Strike Data Visualization project provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to bird strikes and their impact on aviation. The analysis reveals critical patterns, such as increased frequency of incidents, higher risk during certain flight phases, and the economic consequences of bird strikes. These findings emphasize the importance of targeted mitigation strategies, improved pilot warning systems, and enhanced monitoring during clear weather conditions to reduce the occurrence and impact of bird strikes, ultimately contributing to safer skies.
